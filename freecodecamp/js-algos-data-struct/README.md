    * Started Oct 7, 2020; Ended Oct 24, 2020.  
    * 111 lessons in 18 days.

Not sure what to pursue after this one is completed
My eventual goal is to learn JAMstack and serverless.
So the interesting modeule is APIs and Microservices.
But I don't know if I will be able to follow the APIs and Microservices without completing the other modules:
  * Front End Libraries
  * Data Visualization
  * Responsive Web Design
