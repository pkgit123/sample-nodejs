Not sure what to pursue after this one is completed.

My eventual goal is to learn JAMstack and serverless.

So the interesting modeule is APIs and Microservices.

But I don't know if I will be able to follow the APIs and Microservices without completing the other modules:
  * Front End Libraries
  * Data Visualization
  * Responsive Web Design
