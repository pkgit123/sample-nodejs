/**
 * Introduction to the ES6 Challenges
 * 
 * ECMAScript is a standardized version of JavaScript with the goal of unifying the language's specifications and features. 
 * As all major browsers and JavaScript-runtimes follow this specification, the term ECMAScript is interchangeable with the term JavaScript.
 * 
 * Most of the challenges on freeCodeCamp use the ECMAScript 5 (ES5) specification of the language, finalized in 2009. 
 * But JavaScript is an evolving programming language. As features are added and revisions are made, new versions of the language are released for use by developers.
 * 
 * The most recent standardized version is called ECMAScript 6 (ES6), released in 2015.
